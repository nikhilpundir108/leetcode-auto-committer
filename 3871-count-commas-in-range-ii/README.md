## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`.

Return the **total** number of commas used when writing all integers from `[1, n]` (inclusive) in **standard** number formatting.

In **standard** formatting:

	- A comma is inserted after **every three** digits from the right.

	- Numbers with **fewer** than 4 digits contain no commas.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 1002

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

The numbers `"1,000"`, `"1,001"`, and `"1,002"` each contain one comma, giving a total of 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 998

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

**​​​​​​​**All numbers from 1 to 998 have fewer than four digits. Therefore, no commas are used.

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 10^15`
