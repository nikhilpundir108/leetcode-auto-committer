# [2119. A Number After a Double Reversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/a-number-after-a-double-reversal/)

## Difficulty: `Easy` | Topics: `Math`

## 📝 Problem Statement

**Reversing** an integer means to reverse all its digits.

	- For example, reversing `2021` gives `1202`. Reversing `12300` gives `321` as the **leading zeros are not retained**.

Given an integer `num`, **reverse** `num` to get `reversed1`, **then reverse** `reversed1` to get `reversed2`. Return `true` *if* `reversed2` *equals* `num`. Otherwise return `false`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = 526
Output: true
Explanation: Reverse num to get 625, then reverse 625 to get 526, which equals num.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = 1800
Output: false
Explanation: Reverse num to get 81, then reverse 81 to get 18, which does not equal num.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: num = 0
Output: true
Explanation: Reverse num to get 0, then reverse 0 to get 0, which equals num.
```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `0 <= num <= 10^6`
